# Project-2-My-To-Do-List

 **The website is a To-do application which helps users manage their tasks. Tasks are displayed clearly. Users can edit their tasks by clicking the edit button. They can delete them by clicking the delete button. Tasks can be marked as complete. If a user tries to add an empty task, an error alert will appear.**

# Design

## Colour Scheme
**Background colour:** Light blue: This gives the site a calm appearance, making a welcoming atmosphere.

**Text colour:** Black: The main text throughout the site is in black, which provides high contrast against the light blue background. This ensures readability and clarity.

**Buttons:** 
* Add button: Has a white background with black text, this makes it look clean and easy to use.
* Delete button: Is red, symbolizws urgency making it easy for users to identify. It draws attentions to the user.
* Edit button: Is light blue which aligns with the sites colour scheme.

**Error message:** Red: Indicates a warning, catching the user's attention to alert them about an empty task input.

**Task status:** Text colour black with a line through. 

**Header and footer:** White: Creates a simple and clean contrast with the light blue background.

**The combination of light blue, white and black gives the site a calm, modern and clean look. The use of red for error and delete buttons draws attention to alert the user. This combination makes the interface user-friendly.**

## Typography
 * I have chosen to use Arial for the general text because it is easy to read, simple and modern.
 * I chose Tangerine for the header and footer to give it a more refined and elegant look.
 * The combination of Arial for the main content and Tangerine for the header and footer works well becasue it balances readablity with a refined look.
